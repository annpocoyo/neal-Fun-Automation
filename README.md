A collection of scripts automating various aspects of the website: <https://neal.fun>!

## Compatiblilty

These scripts currently have tested to be compatible with **macOS** and **Windows** using Python **3.12.2**!

## Dependiences

The Automatic Password Game script requires the following modules:

* Chess - For getting the chess game data
* Stockfish - For getting the best chess move
* Requests - For getting todays wordle
* Selenium - For automating and controlling the browser

Alongside these modules the script also requires the programs **Firefox and geckodriver** to be installed. (Chrome has some **bugs** with emojis that make it **impossible** to use!)
